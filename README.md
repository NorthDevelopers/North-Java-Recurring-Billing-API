# Securely Embed Recurring Payments in a Java App

This is a Java ecommerce application that embeds a checkout form for subscription billing in a website with [North's Recurring Billing API](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/card-not-present/recurring-billing-api). The full-stack code in this repository adds a recurring payment form to a website, handling both the front-end and back-end aspects of the payment process.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [North Developer Portal account](https://developer.paymentshub.com/auth/signup). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. After you log in, check out the official [Recurring Billing API Specification](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/card-not-present/recurring-billing-api/recurring-billing/production/createandmanagesubscriptions), then [contact](https://developer.paymentshub.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
